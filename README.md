Acknowledgements
The Vehicle Rental System is a Java-based application designed to allow users to rent and return vehicles. It runs inside a Docker container for easy deployment and portability.
Objective
The main objective of this project is to build a simple yet efficient vehicle rental system that allows users to view available vehicles, rent, and return them. The system maintains vehicle status in memory and ensures smooth functionality.
Introduction / Description of Internship
This project was developed as part of an internship to gain hands-on experience in Java development, Docker containerization, and software deployment. The focus was on building a functional and scalable application.
Internship Activities
•	Developing the Java-based console application.
•	Implementing core functionalities: viewing, renting, and returning vehicles.
•	Dockerizing the application for easy deployment.
•	Writing and testing algorithms for rental management.
•	Documenting the process and findings.
Approach / Methodology
•	Programming Language: Java
•	Development Tools: VS Code, Maven
•	Containerization: Docker
•	Process:
1.	Define system requirements and functionalities.
2.	Develop and test core features.
3.	Containerize using Docker.
4.	Deploy and evaluate system performance.
Assumptions
•	The application is run as a console-based system.
•	No user authentication is required.
•	Vehicles are available for rental upon application startup.
Exceptions / Exclusions
•	No integration with a database (vehicle data is stored in memory).
•	No web interface or API implementation.
•	No complex pricing or billing system.

Algorithms
•	Vehicle Rental Algorithm
1.	Display available vehicles.
2.	Accept user input for vehicle selection.
3.	Check rental status.
4.	If available, mark vehicle as rented.
5.	If already rented, display a message.
•	Vehicle Return Algorithm
1.	Accept user input for vehicle return.
2.	Check rental status.
3.	If rented, mark vehicle as available.
4.	If already available, display a message.
Reflections on the Internship
This project provided valuable experience in software development, containerization, and deployment. Working with Docker improved my understanding of application portability and scalability.

Recommendations
•	Implement a database for persistent vehicle data.
•	Add a web-based interface for a better user experience.
•	Integrate authentication and user management features.
Outcome / Conclusion
The Vehicle Rental System successfully allows users to view, rent, and return vehicles efficiently. Dockerization makes it easy to deploy across different environments. Future enhancements could further improve its functionality and usability.
